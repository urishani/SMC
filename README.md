Semantic Mediation Container is a web service tool to transform ontological (RDF) data sets based on their OWL ontologies and a bridging (OWL) ontology.
This tool is originated from IBM, develolped during the SPRINT, DANSE and PSYMBIOSYS EU projects and used mainly to provide interoperability among system engineering modeling tools. During the PSYMBIOSYS project, this tool is being migrated to the open source community to be hosted on this Github repository.

This is a TBD work.
