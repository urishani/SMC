To build the project and install it as a plugin on the Rhapsody 7.6 installed on this machine:
Run tools/build.xml ... as Ant Build.

The result is also the zip file in build/rhapsody.plugin.zip. This is the element to ship to customers to build
and install on their Rhapsody clients.

This zip contains all the instructions and components to do that. All OSS jars will be imported from the internet.

Similarly, to install the plugin on Rhapsody 8.0.2 on your machine, do this build.xml on the Sm.Rhapsocy.dev.8.0.2 project.


This ant file also updates the shared project  com.ibm.haifa.smc.rhapsody.plugin. This project is actually the source 
of the customer installation zip file created in the build/ folder here.
